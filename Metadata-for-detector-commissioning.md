# Metadata for detector commissioning

| Version | Date | Comment |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | 2018-06-18 | Initial version. Contains bare minimum for first usable release of an O2 bookkeeping system. |
| 2 | 2018-06-22 | Add clarification on amount of entries per run. Add info about EPNs being able to leave/join run dynamically. |


# Introduction

This document describes the metadata needed for detector commissioning.
It does not try to say how this metadata will be implemented in a database schema.

# Run general info
- This section lists the information which is stored at the run level, i.e., one global value per run.  
- Some of the data might be derived from other lower-level data (example: “Data volume readout” is the sum of the “Data volume readout” of all the individual Readout processes running in each FLP). 
- Data insertion might be split in different calls.
